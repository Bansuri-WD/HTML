    <ol><li>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? </li>
    <ul><li>HTML tags and elements are not the same thing. <br>HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content. <br> HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail. Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements. <br> HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. <br> On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, as you can see in the above illustration.</li></ul>

    <li>What are tags and attributes in HTML?</li>
    <ul><li> The main difference between tag and attribute is that a tag is a way of representing an HTML element in the program, <br> while an attribute is a way of describing the characteristics of an HTML element.</li></ul>
    <ul><li> HTML contains various elements to build the content. Elements such as paragraph, horizontal lines and headings are used to <br> develop the structure of all webpages. Programmer cannot write these elements directly on the website. He has to use tags to write specific elements to the webpage. Most elements have a start tag and an end tag. In other words, the elements are enclosed within the start and end tag. Furthermore, elements such as line break and horizontal line do not have close tags. Few example HTML elements with tags are as follows.</li></ul>

    <ul><li>An attribute provides extra information about an HTML element. It has two sections: the name of the attribute and the value of that attribute.  The name defines the property that we require to set, while the value is a property that defines the value of that property. The programmer can write the value inside quotations.</li></ul>

    <li> What are void elements in HTML?</li>
    <ul><li>Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end of the element.

      There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. Example of such elements are &lt;br &gt;,  &lt;hr &gt;, &lt;img &gt;, &lt;input &gt;, &lt;link &gt; &lt;base &gt;, &lt;meta &gt;, &lt;param &gt; , &lt;area &gt;, &lt;embed &gt;,<br> &lt; col &gt;, &lt;track &gt; &lt;source &gt; etc.</li></ul>

      <li> What are HTML Entities?</li>
      <ul><li>HTML character entities are used as a replacement of reserved characters in HTML. You can also replace characters that are not present on your keyboard by entities.

        These characters are replaced because some characters are reserved in HTML. HTML entities provide a wide range of characters which can allow you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, etc.</li></ul>

      <ul><li> <b>For example:</b> if you use less than (<) or greater than (>) symbols in your text, the browser can mix them with tags that's why character entities are used in HTML to display reserved characters.</li></ul>

      <li> What are different types of lists in HTML?</li>
      <ul><li>HTML lists allow the content to follow a proper semantic structure. All the tags in the list require opening and closing tags. There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:</li></ul>
       Unordered List ,Ordere List , Discription List


       <li> What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? </li>

       <ul><li>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. <br>

        The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.</li></ul>
       <ul><li>The class attribute is part of the Global Attributes, and can be used on any HTML element.</li></ul>
       


       <li>What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML 
        elements? </li>

        <ul><li> The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. </li></ul>

       

        <li>What are the various formatting tags in HTML? </li>

        <ul><li>HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined. There are almost 14 options available that how text appears in HTML and XHTML.</li></ul>

       <li> How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</li>

       <ul><li>cellpadding and cellspacing are the two attributes used for formatting table cells. Both cellpadding and cellspacing are used to insert whitespaces in the table cells.

       <li> How are active links different from normal links?</li>

       <ul><li>Websites are designed to point you to different resources. You can move from one website to another through links. Links help you to get information from different resources. Links are established in simple HTML web pages through &lt; a &gt; tag.
        Links are categorized into three types. Typically a Link is displayed in three different colors based on the usage.</li></ul>

      <ol><li>Normal links (Unvisited links)</li>
      <li>Visited links </li>
      <li>Active links </li></ol> <br>

      <b>Normal Link</b>

       <p>The following example shows the basic example for Normal Link ( Unvisited Link ). If you want to create a link to go to “https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/“, you can get the normal link through this code. The default color is blue color and underlined but you can apply your own custom styling according to the application’s need.</p>

      <b>Visited Link</b>

      <p>In example 1, If you click on the link shown above and again go back to the link page, you can now see the link is in purple color and underlined. It shows that the user has visited this link before.</p>

      <img src="visitedLink.png" alt="" width="450"> <br> <br>

      <b> Active Link</b>

      <p> In example 1, If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. Active Links shows that the browser is in the process to load a new resource.</p>

          <li>• What is difference between HTML and XHTML? 
          </li>

          <ul><li>HTML and XHTML are two of the most popular markup languages used for developing web pages and applications. HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.

            HTML and XHTML both have features to create rich and interactive web pages and applications. Some of the most popular HTML and XHTML features include:</li></ul>

           <p> Support for multimedia: Both HTML and XHTML support various forms of multimedia, such as images, video, and audio. HTML also supports animated images and graphics. <br>
Styling: Both HTML and XHTML offer a wide range of options for styling web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the most commonly used style sheet language, and it can be used to style both HTML and XHTML documents. <br> <br>
Scripting: HTML and XHTML both support various forms of scripting, such as JavaScript. Scripting can be used to add interactivity to web pages and applications. <br>
Forms: Forms are one of the most important features of HTML and XHTML. Forms allow users to input data, which can then be processed by a server-side script. <br>
Tables: Tables are another important feature of HTML and XHTML. Tables can be used to display tabular data, such as product information or financial data. <br>
Links: Links are one of the most basic features of HTML and XHTML. Links allow users to navigate between web pages. <br>
Metadata: Metadata is information about a web page or document. It can include information such as the author, keywords, and description. <br>
